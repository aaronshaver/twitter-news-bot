# INITIALISE

# Initialise a MarkovBot instance
tweetbot = MarkovBot()

# Get the current directory's path
dirname = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
# Construct the path to the book
book = os.path.join(dirname, u'big.txt')
# Make your bot read the book!
tweetbot.read(book)


# # # # #
# TEXT GENERATION

# Generate text by using the generate_text method:
# 	The first argument is the length of your text, in number of words
# 	The 'seedword' argument allows you to feed the bot some words that it
# 	should attempt to use to start its text. It's nothing fancy: the bot will
# 	simply try the first, and move on to the next if he can't find something
# 	that works.
my_first_text = tweetbot.generate_text(25, seedword=[u'the', u'first'])

# Print your text to the console
print(u'\ntweetbot says: "%s"' % (my_first_text))


# # # # #
# TWITTER

# The MarkovBot uses @sixohsix' Python Twitter Tools, which is a Python wrapper
# for the Twitter API. Find it on GitHub: https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter

# ALL YOUR SECRET STUFF!
# Make sure to replace the ''s below with your own values, or try to find
# a more secure way of dealing with your keys and access tokens. Be warned
# that it is NOT SAFE to put your keys and tokens in a plain-text script!

# Log in to Twitter
tweetbot.twitter_login(twitter_secrets.cons_key, twitter_secrets.cons_secret, twitter_secrets.access_token,
                       twitter_secrets.access_token_secret)

# The target string is what the bot will reply to on Twitter. To learn more,
# read: https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/request-parameters#track

# will attempt to use them as seeds for the reply

# The maxconvdepth is the maximum depth of the conversation that the bot will
# still reply to. This is relevant if you want to reply to all tweets directed
# at a certain user. You don't want to keep replying in the same conversation,
# because that would be very annoying. Be responsible, and allow your bot only
# a shallow conversation depth. For example, a value of 2 will allow the bot
# to only reply in conversations where there are two or less replies to the
# original tweet.
